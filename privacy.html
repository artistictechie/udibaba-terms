          <h2>Welcome To UDI Baba’s Privacy Policy!</h2>
          <p>
            If you decide not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to walk away with a few key points about

            <li>We use third-party cloud providers – specifically, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services – to
              process and analyze your photographs.</li>

          <p>
          <h2>Security</h2>
          </p>
          <p>

            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
            of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
            storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
            guarantee its absolute security.
